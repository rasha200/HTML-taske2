 <p><mark>When we give instructions to a computer through code,</mark> we are, in our own way, communicating with the computer.
     But since computers are built differently than we are, we have to translate our instructions in a way that computers
      will understand.Computers interpret instructions in a very literal manner, so we have to be very specific in how we 
      program them.<ins>Think about instructing someone to walk.</ins>  If you start by telling them, “Put your foot in front of yourself,
      ” do they know what a foot is? Or what front means? (and now we understand why it’s taken so long to develop bipedal robots…).
       In coding, that could mean making sure that small things like punctuation and spelling are correct. Many tears have been shed over
        a missing semicolon (;) <mark>a symbol that a lot of programming languages use to denote the end of a line.</mark></p>

<p>Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating
     and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine 
     code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger
      overall process – with the terms programming,</p>

<p>The first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate
     a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine</p>
